# Projects
This Repository contains some of my end of semster projects I would like to show. 

Project 1
In folder dbProject is a Databse project using a few different lauguages: PHP, mySQL, and basic HTML to display the infomation.
More details are provided in the project README. 

Project 2
In the folder PythonProject I utilize python and some diffrent library and data sets from goverment website using public infomation.  

Project 3 
This was one of my first real project with python. My schools server had a vunerablitly which this code was to work through. After recieving permission to conduct this project
I made a password cracker that used brute force to break alpha numeric passwords. I chose alpha numenric due to the compiting power availbe and I didnt want this program to run
for too long. The vunerablilty of the system was that it would allow unlimited log in attempts with no lockout feature so any brute force algorithm would crack even the sys
admins password. Shortly after this project the schools server was updated or changed to prevent this but it was a fun project.
