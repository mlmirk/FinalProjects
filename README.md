# Projects
This Repository contains some of my end of semester projects I would like to show.

Project 1 In folder dbProject is a Database project using a few different languages: PHP, mySQL, and basic HTML to display the information. More details are provided in the project README.

Project 2 In the folder PythonProject I utilize python and some different libraries and data sets from government websites using public information.

Project 3 This was one of my first real projects with python. My school's server had a vulnerability which this code was to work through. After receiving permission to conduct
this project I made a password cracker that used brute force to break alphanumeric passwords. I chose alphanumeric due to the computing power available and I didnt want this
program to run for too long. The vulnerability of the system was that it would allow unlimited login attempts with no lockout feature so any brute force algorithm would crack
even the sys admins password. Shortly after this project the school's server was updated or changed to prevent this but it was a fun project.
